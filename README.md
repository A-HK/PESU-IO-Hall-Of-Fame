### 2. If you don't have git set up on your machine, install it with the help of this link : [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

**To see if Git is installed on your system, open your terminal and type git --version . If your terminal returns a Git version as an output, that confirms you have Git installed on your system. If not, you have to download Git for Mac or Windows.**
